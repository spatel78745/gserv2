Problem 1:
 Currently, there are two ways to make a ClientSocket:
  1. Using host, port:
   - cliSock = ClientSocket('host', 1234)
   
  2. Using an existing connection:
   - Isn't this a 'copy constructor'?
   - cliSock = ClientSocket()
     cliSock.setSocket(connection)

 Another POV: ClientSocket is a 'decorator' for connections. So maybe the
 solution is to build ClientSocket on top of Connection. Then ClientSocket
 inherits from Connection. Let's give this a whirl.
